# 3D Cell Scaffold Generator (3D CSG) üíªüî¨üß´


**What:** 3D Cell Scaffold Generator (3D CSG) is a Grasshopper-based algorithmic toolset created by Dr Matthew Chin to generate bioinspired, 3D printable scaffolds. This toolset was developed as part of a project to create cell scaffolds recapitulating the structural complexity of tissue microenvironments.

**Why:** Cells interact with a wide variety of physical networks inside the human body. The connectivity of these networks has been shown to a wide range of cell behaviours. Thus, 3D cell culture platofrms, such as [cell scaffolds](https://www.wikilectures.eu/w/Scaffolds_in_tissue_engineering), are typically designed to possess a network architecture that supports the migration and growth of cells. Despite this, [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) (the mathematical study of graphs/networks) is rarely applied to drive the design of 3D cell scaffolds. To understand how the organisation of networks affects scaffold-adhered cells, we need a way to design networks that reflect the complex topologies found in microenvironments and fabricate them. 

**How:** <u>Note: step-by-step instructions are provided in the Grasshopper file (scaffold_AMI.gh).</u> To design the scaffolds, we took inspiration from [fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_stromal_cell) typically found in secondary lymphoid organs (e.g. lymph nodes). FRC networks are essentially the "motorways" that support the migration of immune cells (e.g. T cells and dendritic cells) and maintain normal functioning of the immune system. These networks are organised in a so-called "[small-world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network)" fashion. To generate small-world networks in 3D, we created an algorithm using Grasshopper in Rhino. The network generation is based on a random geometric graph model, previously used by Soekarjo *et al.* to model FRC networks *in silico*. We incorporated this model in our Grasshopper algorithm and added operations to improve the 3D printability of the generated structures. 

**Applications:** Scaffolds generated by this method are intended to be fabricated by [two-photon polymerisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiphoton_lithography) and used as a 3D cell culture platform in tissue engineering and cell biology research.

# Getting started üöÄ

This algorithmic toolset was built using [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/), a graphical algorithm editor available in the computer-aided design (CAD) application, [Rhino 7](https://www.rhino3d.com/).

To use some of the components in the toolset, third-party Grasshopper plug-ins will need to be installed:
